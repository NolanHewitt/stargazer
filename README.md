### MVP

1. Rotating image of the sun/moon at a specific date and time while using the geolocation of the user's device
2. Compass feature is based off of the users phone magnetic north on the app
3. User Authentication/Login
4. Users can leave comments and the main page will show the most recent comments of all users anonymously
5. The comments can be evaluated using the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer Api to determine the "tone" of the comment (joy, sadness, fear, anger, confident, analytical, tentative, or no tone identified)

### Future Enhancements
1. Users can also view a history of their own comments
2. Emojis correspond with the "tone" of the comment
